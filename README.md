A Saturday hack project to play around with getUserMedia.

Get access to a user's camera.
On some user input, take 6 pictures, putting each in a section of an hidden canvas element.

Add ability to copy image
Add ability to keep a roll of images (localStorage)
Add back end to save or email images (maybe put into a toEmail queue)
